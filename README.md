## 🤖 Human Robot Interaction for Puzzle Solving

This repository contains the project developed for the **"Human Robot Interaction" (HRI) and "Reasoning Agent" (RA)** courses at **La Sapienza University of Rome**, taught by **Prof. Luca Iocchi** and **Prof. Luca Patrizi**.

### 📌 Overview

The project focuses on **human-robot collaboration** through a **puzzle game** where a human user and a **Pepper robot** take turns swapping puzzle pieces. The goal is to **enhance interaction between humans and autonomous agents** while ensuring an optimal and engaging experience.

The system has three main components:

1. **🖥️ Server**: Handles the game logic, computes optimal solutions for the puzzle, and determines the best moves using an algorithm (to be specified). It also monitors user performance and provides assistance when needed.
2. **📱 Android App**: Simulates Pepper’s tablet interface, providing an intuitive way for the human player to interact with the robot.
3. **🚀 Robot Control (Docker)**: Manages Pepper’s movements using Docker and the official developer tools, allowing the enhancement of the interation.

### 🎮 Features

- **🧩 Optimal Puzzle Solving**: The server computes the best sequence of moves for solving the puzzle in the fewest steps possible.
- **💡 Interactive Assistance**: If the user makes multiple errors, Pepper engages with them, offering help and guidance.
- **🔄 Turn-Based Gameplay**: Both the human and Pepper take turns swapping pieces, promoting collaborative problem-solving.
